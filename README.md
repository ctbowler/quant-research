ðŸ“Š Quantitative Finance Research Portfolio
This repository presents a curated collection of research projects in quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and stochastic modeling. Each folder contains a self-contained analysis or trading strategy with a focus on simulation-based methods, time series modeling, and financial signal interpretation.

ðŸ§  Project Highlights
Kalman Filter-Based Pairs Trading
Dynamic hedge ratio estimation using a Kalman filter for spread-based statistical arbitrage.

Heston vs Black-Scholes Volatility Modeling
Monte Carlo simulation comparing option pricing and implied volatility surfaces under stochastic (Heston) and constant (Black-Scholes) volatility models.

AR-GARCH Forecasting for Index Additions
Time series modeling of returns and volatility following index inclusion events using AR and GARCH models.

Momentum Trading on Index Additions
Event-driven momentum strategy leveraging z-score thresholds and trade flow data for signal generation.

Each project includes Python code, visualizations, and brief write-ups focused on the core modeling techniques and their applications in trading, pricing, or risk forecasting.

ðŸ“Ž Designed for research, portfolio building, and job applications in quantitative trading, research, or financial engineering.
