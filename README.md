# 📊 Quantitative Finance Research Portfolio

This repository presents a curated collection of research projects in quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and stochastic modeling. Each folder contains a self-contained analysis or trading strategy with a focus on simulation-based methods, time series modeling, and financial signal interpretation. All listed Sharpe ratios come from backtesting. 

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- **Kalman Filter-Based Pairs Trading (Sharpe = 2.66)**  
  Dynamic hedge ratio estimation using a Kalman filter for spread-based statistical arbitrage.
  

- **Heston vs Black-Scholes Volatility Modeling**  
  Monte Carlo simulation comparing option pricing and implied volatility surfaces under stochastic (Heston) and constant (Black-Scholes) volatility models. No backtesting, purely for model analysis and understanding. 

- **AR-GARCH Forecasting for Index Additions (Sharpe = 2.75)**  
  Time series modeling of returns and volatility following index inclusion events using AR and GARCH models.

- **Momentum Trading on Index Additions (Sharpe = 2.99)**  
  Event-driven momentum strategy leveraging z-score thresholds and trade flow data for signal generation.

- **IMC Prosperity Competition**
  This repository contains my trading algorithms developed for the IMC Prosperity Trading Competition. Strategies focus on market making, volatility arbitrage, spread trading, and multi-asset momentum detection across a range of structured products, options, and baskets.
