# ðŸ“Š Quantitative Finance Research Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of research-driven projects in quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and stochastic modeling. Each folder contains a self-contained analysis or strategy implementation, with a focus on simulation-based methods, mathematical modeling, and financial signal interpretation.

## ðŸ§  Highlights include:
- **Kalman Filter-Based Pairs Trading**  
  Adaptive hedge ratio estimation with dynamic spread trading using statistical arbitrage

- **Heston vs Black-Scholes Volatility Modeling**  
  Monte Carlo comparison of option prices and implied vol surfaces under stochastic and constant volatility assumptions

- **ARIMA-GARCH and Time Series Volatility Models**  
  Forecasting returns and conditional variance with autoregressive and heteroskedastic models (work in progress, goal is Sharpe 2.5+)

Each project includes Python code, plots, and documentation that emphasize core modeling insights and practical applications in pricing, risk, or signal extraction.
