# ðŸ“Š Quantitative Trading Strategies

This repository showcases research projects in **quantitative finance**, **algorithmic trading**, and **systems development**. Each folder contains a self-contained analysis or strategy, focused on simulation-based methods, time series models, and financial signal interpretation.

All Sharpe ratios below reflect **out-of-sample backtesting** only â€” no real capital was deployed. Full writeups and code are included in each folder.

## ðŸ”¶ Project Highlights

### ðŸ”¹ Crypto Mean Reversion + Paper Trader  
**Sharpe varies by coin**  
- Mean reversion strategy using Kalman-filtered dynamic mean estimation  
- Alpha signals generated from z-scores and RSI  
- Backtested on 5 crypto assets  
- Includes a paper trading script integrated with Alpaca

### ðŸ”¹ Index Inclusion Strategies  

**AR-GARCH Forecasting**  
**Sharpe = 2.75**  
- Time series modeling of returns and volatility post-index inclusion  
- Combines AR and GARCH models to predict short-term movements

### ðŸ”¹ Passive Momentum Strategy  
**Sharpe = 1.74**  
- Long-only cross-sectional momentum with 12-month holding period  
- Filters by liquidity, beta, return smoothness, and 2â€“12 month momentum  
- Tested across two market regimes (uptrend & drawdown)
- [Link](https://github.com/ctbowler/quant-research/tree/master/passive-momentum)
---

### ðŸ”¹ Kalman Pairs Trading  
**Sharpe = 2.66**  
- Statistical arbitrage using Kalman filter for dynamic hedge ratio estimation  
- Mean-reverting spread modeled and traded using z-score thresholds

### ðŸ”¹ IMC Prosperity Trading Competition  
- Live competition codebase with trading logic across:  
  - Market making  
  - Options pricing (Black-Scholes)  
  - Spread trading  
  - Multi-asset momentum

### ðŸ”¹ Heston vs Black-Scholes Volatility Models  
*No Sharpe â€” model analysis only*  
- Monte Carlo simulation comparing option prices and vol surfaces  
- Highlights differences between stochastic (Heston) and constant (B-S) volatility assumptions

## ðŸ”¶ Systems & Infrastructure Projects

### ðŸ”¹ Low-Latency C++ Crypto Trading Engine  
**Real-time Coinbase GUI with custom order book and candlestick charting**  
- Built in **C++20** with ImGui + OpenGL for low-latency visualization  
- Uses **shared memory (`mmap`)** to stream real-time order book + trade data from a Python WebSocket client  
- Implements custom **OrderBook**, **PriceBuffer**, and **CandleBuffer** data structures for efficient constant-time access  
- Tick rate decoupled from GUI â€” user-defined update frequency (e.g., 10ms)  
- Designed for **high-frequency market simulation**, with modular components and threading for order parsing, rendering, and memory I/O  
- Optimized for <1ms latency if upgraded to a native C++ WebSocket client
